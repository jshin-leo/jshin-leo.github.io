### Graduate Coursework Projects – 2024

**Program:** M.S. in Computer Science  
**Institution:** University of Texas at El Paso  
**Project Period:** Spring & Fall 2024   

**Overview**  
Selected project-based coursework completed as part of the M.S. program.

### Spring 2024

**Theory of Computation** *(Individual Project)*  
Analyzed and formally described the **Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)**, focusing on exploration–exploitation trade-offs and swarm-based metaheuristic design.

**Computer Networks** *(Group Project)*  
Designed and implemented the **Battery ATM Protocol**, a UDP-based communication protocol enabling dynamic coordination between electric vehicles and battery charging stations, validated through network simulation.

**Artificial Intelligence** *(Group Project)*  
Developed a **two-player Scrabble AI system**, implementing backtracking, heuristic search, Monte Carlo simulation, and UCT to compare decision-making strategies.

### Fall 2024

**Advanced Algorithms** *(Individual Project)*  
Formally proved the correctness of the **K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)** algorithm using loop invariants and analyzed its time complexity.

**Computer Security** *(Group Project)*  
Implemented and evaluated machine learning approaches (**CNN, MAML, MORSE**) for **malware family classification under noisy and imbalanced labels**, using real-world datasets.

**Machine Learning** *(Individual Project)*  
Built predictive models using **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and MLPs** on the **TEDS-D public health dataset**, emphasizing data preprocessing, feature encoding, and model evaluation.
