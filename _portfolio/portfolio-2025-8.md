### [CTU/UTEP] RedMorph: Generalization and Adaptation of Autonomous Cyber Attack Agents  

**Organizations:** Czech Technical University (CTU) & University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP)  
**Role:** Research Assistant – Meta-Reinforcement Learning Implementation  
**Project Period:** June 2025–Present  

**Overview**  
RedMorph investigates the generalization problem of autonomous attacker agents in cybersecurity environments. The project examines how reinforcement learning agents adapt their learned policies when facing new, unseen network topologies in realistic cybersecurity simulations.  

The research focuses on:  
- Data exfiltration attack scenarios  
- Bridging the gap between theoretical RL assumptions and realistic network dynamics  
- Comparing different adaptation and generalization strategies across learning paradigms  

**Official Repository:**

This work is an international collaboration with CTU and is currently in manuscript preparation.
