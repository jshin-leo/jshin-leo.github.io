Welcome! 
======
I’m **Jihoon Shin**, a Computer Science master’s student at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), specializing in machine learning and meta-learning. My current research explores how these advanced techniques can be applied to real-world problems—particularly in cybersecurity, healthcare, and mental health contexts. 

Before graduate school, I worked at **Hyundai AutoEver Corp**, the IT service provider of Hyundai Motor Group, as a Full-Stack Developer. From 2016 to 2021, I managed six critical systems for Hyundai Engineering & Construction, including HR, Payroll, and Legal Affairs. I developed and maintained web interfaces, managed databases, and supported data-driven decision-making for HR operations.

My IT expertise led to a promotion as IT Manager in **Hyundai E&C**’s HR Task Force Team, where I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the existing HR system and evaluated multiple Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS) to identify the optimal solution for enterprise-wide implementation.

Now in my final semester at UTEP, I’m focused on bridging my industry background with cutting-edge machine learning research to develop innovative, interdisciplinary solutions.
