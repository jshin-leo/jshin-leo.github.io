Welcome! 
======
I am **Jihoon Shin**, an enterprise IT systems professional with a strong background in full-stack development, artificial intelligence, and data-driven solutions. I hold a **Master’s degree in Computer Science** from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), pursued alongside my wife’s relocation to UTEP for her faculty role. My work focused on machine learning and meta-learning, with applications in cybersecurity, healthcare, and mental health.  

Before graduate school, I spent seven years in enterprise IT environments at **Hyundai AutoEver Corp**, the IT service provider for Hyundai Motor Group. From 2016 to 2021, I managed and supported six mission-critical systems for Hyundai Engineering & Construction, including HR, Payroll, and Legal Affairs. My role spanned full-stack web development, database management, system administration, and supporting data-driven decision-making for large-scale HR operations.

This experience led to my promotion to IT Manager in **Hyundai Engineering & Construction**’s HR Task Force Team, where I served for one year. In this role, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of legacy HR systems and evaluated multiple Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS) to inform enterprise-wide system selection and implementation, working closely with both technical teams and business stakeholders.
